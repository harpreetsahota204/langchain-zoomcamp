This overlap score is derived from the `sentence_bleu` score, a metric used in machine translation to evaluate translated sentences' quality.\n","\n","### Key Components\n","\n","1. **N-gram Overlap Score**:\n","   - The `ngram_overlap_score` function calculates the n-gram overlap score between a source and an example using the `sentence_bleu` score.\n","   - This function employs the `sentence_bleu` method with method1 smoothing and auto reweighting. The resulting score ranges between 0.0 and 1.0.\n","\n","2. **Attributes**:\n","   - `examples`: Contains the list of examples the prompt template expects.\n","   - `example_prompt`: The template used to format the examples.\n","   - `threshold`: Determines when the algorithm stops selecting examples. It's set to -1.0 by default.\n","\n","3. **Methods**:\n","\n","   - **`add_example(example: Dict[str, str]) -> None`**:\n","     - Adds a new example to the list.\n","\n","   - **`select_examples(input_variables: Dict[str, str]) -> List[dict]`**:\n","     - Returns examples sorted by their n-gram overlap score with the input in descending order.\n","     - Excludes examples with scores less than or equal to the threshold.\n","\n","### How It Works\n","\n","When you feed a set of input variables to `select_examples`, the selector computes each example's n-gram overlap score in its list. It then arranges these examples based on their scores in descending order. The method continues selecting examples until it either exhausts the examples or finds an example with a score below the set threshold.\n","\n","For example, with a threshold of 0.0, the selector will omit examples with no n-gram overlap with the input. If the threshold exceeds 1.0, it will exclude all examples.\n","\n","This class is handy when you want examples that share common n-grams with the input.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"SHwoQxHppkQN"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["example_selector = NGramOverlapExampleSelector(\n","    examples=examples,\n","    example_prompt=example_prompt,\n","    threshold=-1.0\n",")\n","\n","dynamic_prompt = FewShotPromptTemplate(\n","    example_selector=example_selector,\n","    example_prompt=example_prompt,\n","    prefix=\"Translate yon modern utterance into the tongue of the Bard\",\n","    suffix=\"Modern: {sentence}\\nShakespearean:\",\n","    input_variables=[\"sentence\"]\n",")\n"],"metadata":{"id":"NsR_SL-OhBAX"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["print(dynamic_prompt.format(sentence=\"Someone in a meeting mentioned they didn't want to be part of 'cancel culture'.
