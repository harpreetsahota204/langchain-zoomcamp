These templates demonstrate the desired input/output format and content.\n","\n","This helps to ensure that the model can provide relevant and accurate responses.\n","\n","For chat models, few-shot examples typically consist of simulated conversations between a \"human\" and \"AI\" speaker.\n","\n","Each example has a human message input, and expected AI response output.\n","\n","Few-shot examples for chat models differ from few-shot examples for standard language models in the following ways:\n","\n"," - They are formatted as dialogues rather than just input/output pairs\n","\n"," - The examples model a conversation between two speakers rather than just input -> output\n","\n"," - They help teach the conversational flow and tone in addition to content\n","\n","### To create few-shot examples for a chat model:\n","\n","1. Come up with 3-5 sample conversations representative of your use case\n","\n","2. Format them as alternating human/AI messages\n","\n","3. Pass them to your chat model wrapped in a prompt template like `FewShotChatMessagePromptTemplate`\n","\n","4. The chat model will condition on these examples when making predictions\n","\n","So in summary, few-shot chat examples demonstrate the desired conversational flow to the model through formatted message examples. This guides the model to converse naturally in your domain.\n","\n","\n","# Fixed Examples\n","\n","The most basic (and common) few-shot prompting technique is to use a fixed prompt example. This way you can select a chain, evaluate it, and avoid worrying about additional moving parts in production.\n","\n","### The basic components of the template are:\n","\n"," - `examples`: A list of dictionary examples to include in the final prompt.\n","\n"," - `example_prompt`: converts each example into 1 or more messages through its format_messages method. A common example would be to convert each example into one human message and one AI message response, or a human message followed by a function call message.\n","\n","\n","Later on, you'll learn how to dynamically select prompts using example selectors.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"G18NpUzFq6Ug"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from langchain.prompts import FewShotChatMessagePromptTemplate, ChatPromptTemplate"],"metadata":{"id":"g643xBmEthiG","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1696373411077,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":190,"user":{"displayName":"Harpreet Sahota","userId":"04881662502078178826"}}},"execution_count":7,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# define examples that we want to include\n","examples = [\n","    # Existing examples\n","    {\n","        \"input\": \"Who directed 'Back to the Future'?\",\n","        \"output\": \"'Back to the Future' was directed by Robert Zemeckis.\"\n","    },\n","    {\n","        \"input\": \"What is the name of Marty McFly's father?\",\n","        \"output\": \"Marty McFly's father is named George McFly.\"\n","    },\n","    {\n","        \"input\": \"Which car was turned into a time machine?\",\n","        \"output\": \"The DeLorean DMC-12 car was turned into a time machine.\"\n","    },\n","    {\n","        \"input\": \"Who played the character of Dr. Emmett Brown?\",\n","        \"output\": \"Dr. Emmett Brown was played by Christopher Lloyd.\"\n","    },\n","    {\n","        \"input\": \"What year did Marty travel back to in the first movie?\",\n","        \"output\": \"In the first movie, Marty McFly traveled back to the year 1955.\"\n","    },\n","\n","    # Unrelated questions with song lyrics as answers\n","    {\n","        \"input\": \"Who wrote the novel '1984'?\",\n","        \"output\": \"Don't need money, don't take fame.
