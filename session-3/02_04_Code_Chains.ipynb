While I don't claim to have all the answers, I can offer some philosophical perspectives that might help you navigate this dilemma.\\n\\n1. Self-awareness and acceptance: Start by cultivating self-awareness to understand the nature of your chaotic mind. Recognize that thoughts and emotions come and go, much like passing clouds in the sky. Accept that it is normal to experience chaos at times, and that it doesn't define you as a person. By acknowledging and accepting the chaos, you can begin to detach yourself from it and observe it with a sense of curiosity rather than being consumed by it.\\n\\n2. Mindfulness and living in the present: Practice mindfulness, which involves being fully present in the current moment without judgment. When your mind is chaotic, it often dwells in the past or anxiously anticipates the future. By focusing on the present moment, you can anchor yourself and find peace amidst the chaos. Engage in activities that bring you into the present, such as meditation, deep breathing exercises, or simply paying attention to your senses.\\n\\n3. Embracing uncertainty and impermanence: Chaos often arises from our desire for control and certainty. However, life is inherently uncertain and ever-changing. Embracing this reality can help you find peace. Recognize that chaos is a natural part of the human experience, and instead of resisting it, learn to flow with it. Accept that things will not always go according to plan, and that's okay. Embracing impermanence can free you from the burden of trying to control every aspect of your life.\\n\\n4. Engaging in self-reflection and introspection: Take the time to explore the root causes of your chaotic mind. Engage in self-reflection and introspection to understand your thoughts, emotions, and patterns of thinking. This process can help you uncover deeper insights into yourself and provide a clearer understanding of what triggers your chaotic mind. Through self-reflection, you can also identify any unhelpful beliefs or thought patterns that contribute to the chaos, and work towards replacing them with more positive and constructive ones.\\n\\n5. Seeking support and connection: Remember that you don't have to face inner chaos alone. Seek support from trusted friends, family, or professionals such as therapists or counselors. Engaging in meaningful conversations with others about your experiences can provide new perspectives and insights. Additionally, connecting with like-minded individuals who share similar struggles can create a sense of shared understanding and provide a supportive community.\\n\\nUltimately, finding inner peace amidst a chaotic mind is a journey unique to each individual. It requires patience, self-compassion, and a commitment to personal growth. While the path may not always be linear or easy, exploring these philosophical perspectives can serve as a starting point for your own exploration and discovery.\""],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":43}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["chain.run(\"Describe what caused the Sikh genocide\")"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":209},"id":"1soOc6nIVU4E","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1695997624049,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":31109,"user":{"displayName":"Harpreet Sahota","userId":"04881662502078178826"}},"outputId":"5a2f4b66-c756-493d-8fec-27b9468e028b"},"execution_count":27,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\n","\n","\u001b[1m> Entering new MultiPromptChain chain...\u001b[0m\n","history: {'input': 'Describe the causes of the Sikh genocide'}\n","\u001b[1m> Finished chain.\u001b[0m\n"]},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["\"The Sikh genocide, also known as the 1984 anti-Sikh riots or the Sikh Massacres, refers to a series of violent attacks targeting the Sikh community in India during the first week of November 1984. The events were triggered by the assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi on October 31, 1984, by her Sikh bodyguards in retaliation for Operation Blue Star.\\n\\nTo understand the causes of the Sikh genocide, it is crucial to delve into the historical context of the time. The roots of the tensions can be traced back to the early 1980s when the Sikh community, a religious minority in India, started demanding greater autonomy and recognition for their religious and political rights. The central issue revolved around the demand for a separate Sikh-majority state called Khalistan.\\n\\nIn 1982, Sikh religious leader Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, supported by a faction of Sikh militants, took refuge in the Golden Temple complex in Amritsar, Punjab. The Indian government, under Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, decided to launch Operation Blue Star in June 1984 to flush out Bhindranwale and his armed supporters from the Golden Temple.\\n\\nThe military operation, however, resulted in significant damage to the holiest Sikh shrine and caused the deaths of several innocent civilians caught in the crossfire. This action deeply hurt the Sikh community and led to widespread outrage and resentment.\\n\\nOn October 31, 1984, Indira Gandhi was assassinated by her Sikh bodyguards, which further ignited the already simmering tensions. The news of her assassination spread rapidly, and within hours, mobs fueled by anti-Sikh sentiments began targeting Sikh individuals, homes, businesses, and Gurdwaras (Sikh temples) in various parts of India, particularly in Delhi.\\n\\nSeveral factors contributed to the scale and intensity of the violence during the Sikh genocide. Firstly, there was a lack of political will and inadequate law enforcement response to control the mobs and prevent the violence from escalating. Some reports suggested the involvement of local politicians in inciting and supporting the mobs.\\n\\nSecondly, a deep-rooted prejudice against Sikhs, fueled by stereotypes and a sense of revenge for the Prime Minister's assassination, played a significant role. Sikhs were often falsely associated with the militants who had taken refuge in the Golden Temple complex.\\n\\nLastly, the lack of media coverage and international attention at the time meant that the violence went largely unchecked and the perpetrators faced little consequence for their actions. This further emboldened the mobs and contributed to the scale of the atrocities committed during the genocide.\\n\\nIn the aftermath of the Sikh genocide, thousands of Sikhs lost their lives, suffered injuries, or were displaced from their homes. The events of 1984 remain a painful chapter in Sikh history and continue to be a subject of debate, seeking justice and accountability for the victims and their families.\""],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":27}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# üß¨ Sequential Chains\n","\n","Sometimes you might want to a series of calls to a language model and take the output from one call and use it as the input to another.\n","\n","Sequential chains allow you to connect multiple chains and compose them into pipelines that execute some specific scenario.
