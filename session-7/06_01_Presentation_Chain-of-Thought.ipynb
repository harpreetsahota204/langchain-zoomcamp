During passive inflation, both parts of the diaphragm shortened and abdominal cross-sectional area increased. During passive deflation, both parts of the diaphragm lengthened and abdominal cross-sectional area decreased. We subsequently used the relationship between costal and crural diaphragmatic length, respectively, and abdominal cross-sectional area during passive inflation-deflation to predict the length changes in the costal and crural diaphragm during quiet breathing before and after bilateral phrenicotomy. In the intact animal the inspiratory shortening in the crural diaphragm was almost invariably greater than predicted from the relationship during passive inflation. During inspiration after phrenicotomy the crural diaphragm invariably lengthened, whereas the costal diaphragm often shortened. In general there was a good correlation between the measured and predicted length change for the crural diaphragm (r = 0.72 before and 0.79 after phrenicotomy) and a poor one for the costal diaphragm (r = 0.05 before and 0.19 after phrenicotomy). \n","Question: Does the abstract contain any numerical data?\n","\n","Rationale: The abstract includes numerical data such as the relationship between abdominal cross-sectional area and changes in length in the costal and crural parts of the diaphragm, measured by sonomicrometry.

In the second test the air flow works as it would in a race car spoiler. He labels it as case B. He is surprised to see that air flow behaves differently in different situations.\n","\n","Hint: Bernoulliâ€™s law explains how the wings of both airplanes and birds create lift that allows flight (see Figure below ). The shape of the wings causes air to flow more quickly â€” and air pressure to be lower â€” above the wings than below them. This allows the wings to lift the plane or bird above the ground against the pull of gravity. A spoiler on a race car, like the one in Figure below , works in the opposite way. Its shape causes air to flow more slowly â€” and air pressure to be greater â€” above the spoiler than below it. As a result, air pressure pushes the car downward, giving its wheels better traction on the track.\n","\n","Rationale: According to Bernoulliâ€™s law, the shape of wings causes air pressure above it to be lower than below. The opposite is true for spoilers which cause air pressure above them to be greater than below. In case A, Rob used wing-like design and in case B he used spoiler like design (see Figure).
