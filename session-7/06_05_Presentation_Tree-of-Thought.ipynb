They published a paper titled [Tree of Thoughts: Deliberate Problem Solving with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.10601.pdf), and also Jieyi Long from Theta Labs in the paper titled [Large Language Model Guided Tree-of-Thought](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.08291.pdf)\n","\n","\n","You can dig into the code from Shunyu Yao's group on [GitHub](https://github.com/princeton-nlp/tree-of-thought-llm/tree/master) to see how it's implemented in raw Python code.\n","\n","\n","## ü§ñ **1. What's Tree of Thought Prompting?**\n","\n","\n","- üå≥ **Concept**: ToT is like a brainy framework for smart language models. It helps them solve tricky problems by thinking in a tree-like way, just like we do when we're puzzled!\n","\n","- üß† **Inspiration**: It's all about mimicking how our minds tackle tough tasks‚Äîexploring, trying different things, and backtracking if we hit a dead end.\n","\n","<figure>\n","  <img src=\"https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2305.10601/assets/x1.png\" alt=\"Image Description\" style=\"width:100%\">\n","  <figcaption>Schematic illustrating various approaches to problem solving with LLMs. Each rectangle box represents a thought, which is a coherent language sequence that serves as an intermediate step toward problem solving.</figcaption>\n","  <a href=\"https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2305.10601\">Image Source</a>\n","</figure>\n","\n","\n","## üîç **2. How Tree of Thought Prompting Functions**\n","\n","- üå≤ **Tree Layout**: In ToT, each node is a mini thought or step towards cracking the problem.\n","\n","- ü§î **Self-Check**: The language model can judge how close these mini thoughts are to solving the puzzle.\n","\n","- üöÄ **Clever Search Strategies**: It mixes the model's thought-creating skills with search tactics like BFS and DFS. This combo lets it plan ahead and backtrack to find the best answers.\n","\n","- üõ†Ô∏è **Extra Tools**: Some versions have cool add-ons, like a checker to confirm solutions, a memory bank for convo history, and a controller to guide the thought journey.\n","\n","<figure>\n","  <img src=\"https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2305.10601/assets/x5.png\" alt=\"Image Description\" style=\"width:100%\">\n","  <figcaption>A step of deliberate search in a randomly picked Creative Writing task. Given the input, the LM samples 5 different plans, then votes 5 times to decide which plan is best. The majority choice is used to consequently write the output passage with the same sample-vote procedure.</figcaption>\n","  <a href=\"https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2305.10601\">Image Source</a>\n","</figure>\n","\n","\n","\n","# üå≤ **3. What Makes Tree of Thought Prompting Stand Out?**\n","\n","- üìè **Old-School Prompting**: Traditional methods are like a straight line‚Äîask a question, get an answer. But they don't really wander around or think ahead.\n","\n","- üîó **Chain-of-Thought Style**: This is a bit like building a solution step-by-step. It's more advanced than the straight line, but still doesn't explore different paths.\n","\n","- üå≥ **ToT's Special Sauce**: ToT is the adventurer of the group. It thinks in multiple directions, can backtrack if a path doesn't work out, and tries different ways to solve a problem.\n","\n","- üéÆ **Teaming up with Reinforcement Learning**: In some setups, ToT pairs up with reinforcement learning. This means it gets even smarter at exploring and finding solutions.\n","\n","üí° **In a Nutshell**: ToT is like the maze-runner of prompting techniques. It's all about exploring far and wide, learning from dead ends, and using smart strategies to tackle complex problems. Way different from just going from A to B!\n","\n","\n","\n","# Let's see ToT in action using LangChain's Experimental library\n","\n","You can find the code [on GitHub](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/tree/master/libs/experimental/langchain_experimental/tot)\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"qhdhxcrk1XOc"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["sudoku_puzzle =   \"3,*,*,2|1,*,3,*|*,1,*,3|4,*,*,1\"\n","sudoku_solution = \"3,4,1,2|1,2,3,4|2,1,4,3|4,3,2,1\"\n","\n","problem_description = f\"\"\"You are expert level Sudoku player working on a 4x4 Sudoku Puzzle.\n","\n","The puzzle is delimited by triple backticks.\n","\n","Here is your puzzle: ```{sudoku_puzzle}```\n","\n","Instructions:\n","- Cells marked with '*' need to be filled.\n","- Use digits 1-4 to fill the cells.\n","- Each row is separated by the '|' character.\n","- Ensure no duplicate digits in any row, column, or 2x2 subgrid.\n","- Retain the known digits from previous valid thoughts.\n","- Your response can be a step towards the solution or the complete solution itself.\n","\"\"\"\n","\n","print(problem_description)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"GYj2TBQ49MCd","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1697203616447,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":259,"user":{"displayName":"Harpreet Sahota","userId":"04881662502078178826"}},"outputId":"bef5ba3b-0d9a-4f2d-edef-a0328ee8e2b7"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["You are expert level Sudokue plater working on a 4x4 Sudoku Puzzle.\n","\n","The puzzle is delimited by triple backticks.\n","\n","Here is your puzzle: ```3,*,*,2|1,*,3,*|*,1,*,3|4,*,*,1```\n","\n","Instructions:\n","- Cells marked with '*' need to be filled.\n","- Use digits 1-4 to fill the cells.\n","- Each row is separated by the '|' character.\n","- Ensure no duplicate digits in any row, column, or 2x2 subgrid.\n","- Retain the known digits from previous valid thoughts.\n","- Your response can be a step towards the solution or the complete solution itself.\n","\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["üå≤ **Exploring `ToTChecker` Class**\n","\n","- `ToTChecker` is a blueprint for evaluating thoughts in a \"Tree of Thought\" format.\n","\n","üîç **Abstract Nature of `ToTChecker`**\n","- Can't be used directly; needs subclasses with implemented methods.\n","\n","üéÆ **Sudoku Example for Implementation**\n","- Implement your logic (like rule-based or AI) in subclasses for specific scenarios like Sudoku."],"metadata":{"id":"EjCF_2-JOvvi"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from langchain_experimental.tot import prompts as tot_prompts"],"metadata":{"id":"zW-joG0RaoH5"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# üî® **Understanding `Jinja2` Template Syntax**\n","\n","- Jinja2 uses `{% ... %}` for loops and conditionals, and `{{ ... }}` for printing expressions.\n","\n","üå± **Dynamic Content with Jinja2**\n","- Templates dynamically generate text using input variables.\n","\n","üå≥ **Tree of Thoughts Framework in COT_PROMPT**\n","- Describes an AI agent generating thoughts.
