        "\n",
        "But what if you could have a chatbot that can crawl websites, understand their content, and provide you with concise answers?\n",

        "# 1. Extracting URLs from Text\n",
        "\n",
        "First, we identify URLs from a given text.\n",
        "\n",
        "This can be any text containing references to websites that you want the chatbot to understand.\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "url_lists = find_urls(text)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "# 2. Load the documents from the web using the WebBaseLoader.\n",
        "\n",
        "Once we have the list of URLs, we load these websites into a document structure, which makes it easier for further processing.\n",
        "\n",
        "This loader allows you to load documents from various sources such as public websites.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Large websites can have overwhelming amounts of content.\n",
        "\n",
        "To make it manageable, we split the content into smaller chunks.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",
        "To determine which splitter to use, you can consider the following:\n",
        "\n",
        " - If you want to split the text based on characters and measure the chunk size by the number of characters, you can use CharacterTextSplitter.\n",
